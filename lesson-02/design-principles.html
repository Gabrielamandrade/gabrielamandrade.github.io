          <p>The TED site have made a good use of the alignment. Even the tags being scattered in a first view, it's
            still
            possible see that they follow a invisible line on center. The text, tags, and button have been centered
            making
            all the content, even being different, follow a standard. This help me to know where should I start to read,
            and what
            is the processes they ask me to do. The alignment makes me like of the layout, and even that it's not my
            plan make an account,
            unconsciously I would do.

          <p>I like the contrast that shows here. I can see the music of the week with more views as the biggest
            in the page and after the logo that calls my attention because of the choice of colors. Even the question
            above the
            search bar being helpful for keeping me there, I didnt like the contrast that have with the image behind.
            If I have not the intent of pay attention in all, I will not read what they have wrote.

          <p> Amazon repeat the same sequence to show their products. They created boxes using different colors, and
            similar
            colors to combine with the logo. It"s easy to navigate, but when you visit for the first time, you take much
            more time
            than you should, to decide what you want. Even with this boxes showing select products for you, they show
            too much options, that could be more filtered.
